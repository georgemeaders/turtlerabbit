Turtle vs Rabbit Race for Code Fellows
To the original race file we worked on as a group in class, I added a new variable called dayOfWeek, which sets a particular day of the week to be Farmer Brown's day to bring home a rabbit for stew (by default this day is set to Thursday).  In the event that you run the script on a Thursday, an If...Else statement makes sure the rabbit is immediately shot and killed and the turtle wins the race.  

I also added an alert that takes place after each run, displaying the current locations of the rabbit and the turtle, as well as a final alert that displays either the turtle wins, or the rabbit wins.
